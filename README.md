# lolly-tools

Community-safe tool definitions for [Lolly](https://github.com/lolly-tools/lolly) -
the constraint-first, template-driven creative-asset platform. Consumed by the
`lolly` monorepo as a git submodule at `community/`, and merged into the active
profile's `tools/` view alongside a brand pack (see the monorepo's `profiles.json`).

These tools are **brand-agnostic**: they declare no catalog asset dependencies,
so they run against any brand pack (SUSE, the blank `lolly-start` brand, or your
own). Each tool is a directory of *data, not code*:

```
<id>/
├── tool.json        # manifest (inputs, render config, examples)
├── template.html    # Handlebars markup (logic-less)
├── styles.css       # optional, auto-scoped
├── hooks.js         # optional imperative escape hatch
├── icon.svg         # gallery icon (Lucide house style)
└── card.svg|html    # optional authored gallery preview
```
