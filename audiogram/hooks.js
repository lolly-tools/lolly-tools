/**
 * Audiogram hooks - turn the chosen clip into a per-frame animation track.
 *
 * The division of labour with template.html is deliberate:
 *
 *   hooks.js (here)  decides WHAT the animation knows - it calls host.audio to
 *                    analyse the clip (all of it, from the in-point to the end,
 *                    at an fps that adapts to its length), derives the brand
 *                    colour ramp from host.color, and hands both to the template
 *                    as a compact packed payload.
 *   template.html    decides how it MOVES - a canvas draw function per style,
 *                    reading that payload. No fetching, no decoding, no colour
 *                    science, and (importantly) no async work during a repaint.
 *
 * The STILL is neither: it is drawn here, as SVG, from the same packed bytes (see
 * stillSvg below). The canvas covers it only while it is painting motion, so a
 * script-less render, a reduced-motion viewer and a docs screenshot all get real
 * vector geometry instead of a snapshot of an animation mid-stride.
 *
 * Why the payload is packed bytes rather than JSON: a frame track is `count ×
 * bands` numbers, so an 8-second clip at 30fps over 48 bands is 11,520 values.
 * As JSON that is ~80 KB of text re-parsed on every keystroke and embedded in
 * every exported HTML file; quantised to bytes and base64'd it is ~15 KB. The
 * values are all normalised 0..1 already, so a byte is the honest precision - a
 * bar's height is being drawn into a pixel grid, not integrated.
 *
 * Everything the template needs travels IN the payload, which is what makes an
 * exported `html` render animate on its own and a headless CLI render draw the
 * same frames as the browser.
 */

/** Analysis frames per second at full rate. Matches the export's default fps, so one

const FPS = 30;

/**
 * Frame budget for the whole animation track - the knob that lets the window follow
 * the clip instead of stopping at 8 seconds. The analysis fps adapts so the frame
 * count stays near this budget: full 30fps up to 2 minutes, then coarser.
 *
 *   fps = clamp(floor(MAX_FRAMES / seconds), FPS_MIN, FPS)
 *
 * What that costs, per second of clip (raw bytes; base64 adds 4/3):
 *
 *   spectrum + scalars (6 + 48 B/frame):  ~1.6 KB/s at 30fps   ~0.32 KB/s at 6fps
 *   scope rows        (1024 B/frame):     ~30 KB/s  at 30fps   ~6 KB/s    at 6fps
 *   vizWave           (1024 B/frame):     ~30 KB/s  at 30fps   ~6 KB/s    at 6fps
 *
 * So the spectrum track lands near MAX_FRAMES × 54 B ≈ 190 KB worst case, and the
 * sample-window styles (scope, milkdrop) near MAX_FRAMES × 1 KB ≈ 3.7 MB - bounded
 * by the budget, not by the clip. Past 10 minutes the fps floor holds at FPS_MIN and
 * the payload grows linearly again, which still works; it is just coarser and

 * which reveals it only while it is painting.
 *
 * The geometry is built from the SAME packed bytes the canvas unpacks, with the
 * same helpers (at / band / kick / posterFrame) and the same constants, so the
 * two agree by construction instead of by two sets of maths staying in step.
 * Read one, change both; tests/audiogram-still-svg.test.ts decodes agData itself
 * and compares the emitted rects against it.
 *
 * Why it was a canvas at all: nothing here needs pixels. plans/69 section 16
 * called the audiogram raster "by implementation, not necessity", and the docs
 * screenshots proved it - they shipped the analysis as an embedded bitmap that
 * changed on every capture because the preview loop was mid-animation.

/**
 * Make the video as long as the audio it is drawing - and an audio-only export the
 * same excerpt the video would have carried.
 *
 * VIDEO: the analysis covers the whole clip from the in-point, but the manifest's
 * default export length is still 8 seconds - so a 5-second voice memo or a 3-minute
 * track would otherwise be walked across the wrong duration and the picture would
 * drift against its own soundtrack. Setting the duration from the analysed span makes
 * the animation and the audio end together by construction, at any clip length.
 *
 * AUDIO (wav/mp3/m4a/opus): the file IS the sound, and the sound is the excerpt the
 * card is about - from "Start at" (stamped on the stage as data-audio-start, which is
 * where the export path reads the in-point) to the end of the clip. The tool applies
 * NOTHING to it: no fade, no normalisation, no gain. The video's soundtrack is the
 * same span played at the export bar's own level, so the two exports agree about the
 * same clip by construction rather than by matching two sets of maths.
 *
 * Leaving `duration` UNSET is what the export path reads as "to the end of the
 * source", and it is also what lets an untrimmed export in the source's own format
 * hand back the original bytes instead of a lossy re-encode. A duration inherited
 * from the video card (the manifest's 8 s default) would silently truncate the sound
 * to something nobody asked for, so it is cleared.
 *
 * Both branches defer to a duration the user chose: the export popup's value is a
 * deliberate instruction and must win. Same stance as the sequence tool's beforeExport.
